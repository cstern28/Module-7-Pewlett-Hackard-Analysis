# Module-7-Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose
To determine the number of retiring employees based on their title and identify the employees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program, which will help us prepare for the "Silver Tsunami" as many emmployees reach the retirement age.

## Results
1.  There are 72,458 employees that are going to retire.
2.  There job roles with significantly more employees retiring are Senior Engineer and Senior Staff. This may be bad to have so many long tenure employees retire at the same time.
3.  Only 2 managers are retiring, so there will be many managers, less seniors, and a lot of staff. This may lead to many promotions of staff to senior role, who are ready to step up in their career.
4. Based on the Mentorship eligibility criteria of being born in the year 1965, there are only 1,549 employees that can become a mentor. Refer to pivot table image created from the mentorship_eligibility table csv file export.

Based on only qualified employees (which means born in 1965), there are not enough employees to mentor the next generation of Pwelett Hackard employees because there are only 1,549 potential mentors. There will be about 368,861 active employees. Refer to the table below, which shows the active number of employees excluding employees that will retire. Unless each mentors takes on about 238 employees to mentor, then there will not be enough mentors.

## Conclusion
The eligibility critera to determine a mentor should be modified to include more employees. The current criteria by born in only 1965 eliminates too many employees as potential mentors and there will not be enough mentors for the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
